# About This project
- Main landing page for Piscatello
# About the code
- Uses tailwind, wordpress , webpack , PHP (mySQL on backend, not present here), jquery
- Works responsively and cross-browser
# Unique challenges
- Their theme had to be converted from a stock WP theme into this custom theme, and I used webpack for compilation. Directory structures differed so they had to be synced so this could easily be pulled/pushed from a local machine to WP. There was not a previous working repository for this site, only a stock theme and assets from the client. This was my first tailwind project.
